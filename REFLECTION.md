# Reflection - Daily Schedule Simulator

## What was your approach to designing the schedule?
I designed it around my work schedule and getting ready. I went pretty simple on it.

## What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?
To be honest, its a little embarrassing but I saved it as a js file at first and it had a lot wrong in the code and I couldn't figure it out, then I realized and changed the filetype.

## What does this assignment teach you about Async code?
This allows for more input, allowing the user to use a button that would otherwise run as the page loads.

## What creative element did you add?
I added a surprise element where if you click on a button, it brings up to 3 unique prompts!

## How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?
This differs in the sense that it documents what I have done as opposed to what I am scheduled to do.
